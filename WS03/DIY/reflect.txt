Default constructor is the constructor function that takes no argument. The purpose of default constructors is to initialize a class instance to the default empty state. Sometimes the default empty state is not a valid state, so it might be necessary to check validity with [isValid] method. Container classes like CalorieList need to check validity of element items in addition to its own attributes. State of a class instance is stored in private attributes to prevent users from directly modifying the state.

Unlike [printf] function, [cout] uses special objects from [iomanip] to format strings. Some formats like [setfill] need to be reset manually after use.

In Food class, the time of consumption had to be converted to its corresponding string (i.e. 1 to "Breakfast"). I solved this problem by saving the strings to global constants then mapping them with a switch clause.

Class instances can be reused without calling the constructor again if there is an [init] function. Calling [deallocate] method is required before each [init] call.
